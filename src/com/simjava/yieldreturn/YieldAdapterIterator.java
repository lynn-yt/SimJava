     * Because the Yield Adapter starts a separate thread for duration of the collection, this can
     * be left open if the calling code only reads part of the collection. If the iterator goes out
     * of scope, when it is GCed its finalize() will close the collection thread. However garbage
     * collection is sporadic and the VM will not trigger it simply because there is a lack of
     * available threads. So, if a lot of partial reads are happening, it will be wise to manually
     * close the iterator (which will clear the resources immediately).
